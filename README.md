## Work

The Coalesce work node is a versatile node that allows you to develop and deploy a Work table/view in Databricks.

A Work node serves as an intermediary object and is commonly employed to store raw data before undergoing the crucial phases of transformation and loading into the main tables of the data warehouse.

This pivotal step ensures that the raw data is processed and structured effectively.

### Work Node Configuration

The Work node type has two configuration groups:

* [Node Properties](#work-node-properties)
* [Options](#work-options)

### Work Deployment

#### Work Initial Deployment

When deployed for the first time into an environment the Work node of materialization type table will execute the below stage:

| **Create Work View** | This will execute a CREATE OR REPLACE statement and create a view in the target environment |

#### Work Redeployment

After the WORK node with materialization type table has been deployed for the first time into a target environment, subsequent deployments may result in either altering the WORK Table or recreating the WORK table.

#### Altering the Work Tables

A few types of column or table changes will result in an ALTER statement to modify the Work Table in the target environment, whether these changes are made individually or all together:

* Changing table names
* Dropping existing columns
* Altering column data types
* Adding new columns

The following stages are executed:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Clone Table** | Creates an internal table |
| **Rename Table\| Alter Column \| Delete Column \| Add Column \| Edit table description** | Alter table statement is executed to perform the alter operation |
| **Swap Cloned Table** | Upon successful completion of all updates, the clone replaces the main table ensuring that no data is lost |
| **Delete Table** | Drops the internal table |

#### Recreating the Work Tables

If any of the following change are detected, then the table will be recreated using a CREATE or REPLACE.

* Join clause

One of the following stages are executed:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Create Table** | Creates a new table |
| **Replace Table** | Replaces an existing table|

#### Recreating the Work Views

The subsequent deployment of Work node of materialization type view with changes in view definition, adding table description or renaming view results in deleting the existing view and recreating the view.

The following stages are executed:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Delete View** | Removes existing view |
| **Create View** | Creates new view with updated definition |

### Work Undeployment

If a Work Node of materialization type table is deleted from a Workspace, that Workspace is committed to Git and that commit deployed to a higher level environment then the WorkTable in the target environment will be dropped.

This is executed in two stages:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Delete Table** | Coalesce Internal table is dropped |
| **Delete Table** | Target table in Databricks is dropped |

If a Work Node of materialization type view is deleted from a Workspace, that Workspace is committed to Git and that commit deployed to a higher level environment then the WorkView in the target environment will be dropped.

The subsequent deployment of View node with changes in view definition, adding table description, adding secure option or renaming view results in deleting the existing view and recreating the view.

The following stages are executed:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Delete View** | Removes existing view |
| **Create View** | Creates new view with updated definition |

#### View Undeployment

If a View Node is deleted from a Workspace, that Workspace is committed to Git and that commit deployed to a higher level environment then the View in the target environment will be dropped.

This is executed in the below stage:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Delete View** | Removes the view from the environment |
